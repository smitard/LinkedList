Prerequisities:

1. Install Visual Studio from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ru/downloads/ or Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools from http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126

2. Open a developer command prompt and verify that the Visual C++ developer command prompt is set up correctly. In the command prompt window, enter cl and verify that the output looks something like this:

       usage: cl [ option... ] filename... [ /link linkoption... ]  
       
   If you can't find the developer command prompt , or if you get an error message when you enter cl, then your Visual C++ installation may have a problem. Try reinstalling the Visual C++ component in Visual Studio, or reinstall the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools.

3. Make sure the make.bat file is in the same folder as List.cpp, main.cpp and cList.h files

4. In the command prompt enter cd and then type the path to your make.bat file ex: cd D:\Nudes then press enter

5. Once you've entered the path to the make.bat file type in the command prompt make.bat

6. Enjoy
